# Packet-Transmission-Control

### Project Description :page_facing_up:
Consider the maximum capacity of a network is 128 packets. The user starts his packets transmission by 1 packet. Then he/she increases the number of packets according to the following rules:
- If the number of transmitted packets < 64 packets, the number will be doubled.
- If the number of transmitted packets ≥ 64 packets, the number will be increased by 1.
- If the number of transmitted packets = 128 packets, the user will start over and transmit 1 packets and repeat the previous rules.

_The input is the size of the transmitted file.
The output is the number of Transmissions used to transmit this file._

The code is written in assembly on emu8086.
